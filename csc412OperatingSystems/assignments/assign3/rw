/*Description: reader.c:
*1b.) (6 points) The second program is invoked as follows: reader 
*The program reads characters until EOF from its standard input and 
*displays that information on screen, with at most 50 characters per line.  
*That is, for every 50 characters read from the input, a '\n' is added to 
*output.  For the last line, even if fewer than 50 characters are 
*printed, add a '\n' character.  (But you must ensure that you do not have an 
*unnecessary blank line if the number of characters in the last line is 
*exactly 50.) The program uses getchar and putchar for this purpose.
